/*
When is the semocolon required

There are two situations in which you must use the semicolon. 
The first situation is where you use a Common Table Expression (CTE), 
and the CTE is not the first statement in the batch. 
The second is where you issue a Service Broker statement 
and the Service Broker statement is not the first statement in the batch.
